Hello! I am **Zhengqian Jin (金正千)**, a direct Ph.D. candidate at Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU).

I work under the guidance of [Prof. Kai Xi](https://x-group-site.webflow.io/) & [Prof. Shujiang Ding](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/dingsj) at the National Innovation Platform (Center) for Industry-Education Integration of Energy Storage Technology. I received my B.S. in Applied Chemistry from Tongji University in 2023.

My research focuses on **lithium metal batteries**, and I am particularly interested in the areas of structure design, catalysts, material synthesis, and exploring the underlying mechanisms.

## Interests & Hobbies

Outside of the lab, I am passionate about:
* **Scientific Visualization**: I enjoy using Python to create meaningful data visualizations.
* **Languages**: I am currently learning Spanish.
* **Sports**: I'm an active follower of Football, UFC, and the NFL.
* **Running**: I run regularly to stay active.

I also run a PaperBot on X (formerly Twitter) that automatically shares new research in the battery field. You can follow it here: **[@EKL_Batteries](https://x.com/EKL_Batteries)**.
